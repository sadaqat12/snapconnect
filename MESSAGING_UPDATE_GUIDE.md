# 💬 SnapConnect: View-Based Message Expiration Update

## 🆕 New Features

### 📱 **View-Based Expiration**
- Messages now disappear **after being viewed** by all participants (like Snapchat)
- No more 24-hour time-based expiration
- Messages are marked as "viewed" when:
  - Text messages: Tapped/opened
  - Snap messages: Viewed through SnapViewer

### 💾 **Save Messages**
- **Long press any message** to save it from expiring
- Saved messages have a green border and 💾 icon
- Saved messages **never expire** until manually unsaved
- Both sender and recipients can save messages

### 👁️ **Status Indicators**
- **For senders**: See who viewed and saved your messages
  - 👁️ 2 = 2 people viewed
  - 💾 1 = 1 person saved
- **For recipients**: Visual hints about message state
  - Yellow border = unviewed message
  - Green border = saved message
  - Gray hint text = interaction instructions

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Message Lifecycle:**
1. **Sent** → Message appears in chat
2. **Viewed** → User taps message (marked as viewed)
3. **Expired** → Auto-expires when all participants view it
4. **Saved** → Long press prevents expiration

### **Database Changes:**
- Added `saved_by[]` - Users who saved the message
- Added `viewed_by[]` - Users who viewed the message  
- Added `is_expired` - Boolean flag for expiration state
- Removed time-based expiration triggers

## 🎯 **User Experience**

### **For Recipients:**
- Tap messages to view them
- Long press to save important messages
- Unviewed messages have yellow border hint
- Saved messages have green border + 💾 icon

### **For Senders:**
- See who viewed your messages (👁️ count)
- See who saved your messages (💾 count)
- Your own messages don't expire from your view

### **UI Hints:**
- Header shows: "💬 Messages disappear after viewing • Long press to save 💾"
- First-time users see: "Tap to view • Long press to save"

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Functions:**
- `mark_message_as_viewed(message_id, user_id)` - Marks message as viewed
- `toggle_message_saved(message_id, user_id)` - Saves/unsaves messages
- `cleanup_expired_messages()` - Removes expired messages

### **Real-time Updates:**
- Messages update live when viewed/saved by others
- Expired messages disappear immediately
- Status indicators update in real-time

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

1. **Basic Flow:**
   - Send text message
   - Recipient taps to view
   - Message expires when all participants view it

2. **Save Feature:**
   - Long press message to save
   - Verify green border + 💾 icon appears
   - Confirm message doesn't expire

3. **Group Chat:**
   - Send message to group
   - Message expires only after ALL members view it
   - Anyone can save to prevent expiration

4. **Status Indicators:**
   - Send message and watch for 👁️ and 💾 counts
   - Verify counts update as recipients interact

## 🚨 **Migration Notes**

- Existing messages with old `expires_at` system still work
- New messages use the view-based system
- Old cleanup functions handle both systems
- Database migration adds new columns safely
