# Correct Snapchat Behavior Implementation

## ✅ **Correct Logic Now**

### The Real Snapchat Behavior:
1. **User A sends message** → User A has automatically "viewed" it (by sending)
2. **User B opens chat** → User B "views" the message
3. **User B leaves chat** → Message expires (all recipients have viewed)
4. **User A doesn't need to "view" again** → They already "viewed" by sending

## 🎯 **Implementation Details**

### Auto-Trigger for Senders:
```sql
-- Senders automatically marked as "viewed" when sending
CREATE TRIGGER auto_mark_sender_viewed_trigger
  BEFORE INSERT ON public.chat_messages
  FOR EACH ROW 
  EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_mark_sender_viewed();
```

### Smart Cleanup Logic:
```sql
-- Only count NON-SENDER participants for expiration
non_sender_participants := array_remove(msg_record.participants, msg_record.sender_id);

-- Message expires when all RECIPIENTS have viewed (sender already "viewed" by sending)
IF non_sender_viewed_count >= participant_count THEN
  -- Mark as expired
END IF;
```

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### Test 1: Direct Message (1-on-1)
1. **User A sends "Hello" to User B**
   - `viewed_by = [User A]` (sender auto-viewed)
   - `non_sender_participants = [User B]`
   - `non_sender_viewed_count = 0`

2. **User B opens chat**
   - `viewed_by = [User A, User B]` (recipient viewed)
   - `non_sender_viewed_count = 1`
   - `participant_count = 1` (only User B is non-sender)

3. **User B leaves chat**
   - Cleanup runs: `1 >= 1` ✅ → Message expires
   - **Result**: Message disappears when recipient leaves

### Test 2: Group Chat (1-to-many)
1. **User A sends message to group [User B, User C]**
   - `viewed_by = [User A]` (sender auto-viewed)
   - `non_sender_participants = [User B, User C]`
   - `non_sender_viewed_count = 0`

2. **User B opens chat**
   - `viewed_by = [User A, User B]`
   - `non_sender_viewed_count = 1`
   - `participant_count = 2` (User B and User C)

3. **User B leaves chat**
   - Cleanup runs: `1 < 2` ❌ → Message persists
   - **User C hasn't viewed yet**

4. **User C opens chat**
   - `viewed_by = [User A, User B, User C]`
   - `non_sender_viewed_count = 2`

5. **User C leaves chat**
   - Cleanup runs: `2 >= 2` ✅ → Message expires
   - **Result**: Message disappears when last recipient leaves

### Test 3: Save Functionality
1. **User A sends message to User B**
2. **User B opens chat and long-presses to save**
   - `saved_by = [User B]`
3. **User B leaves chat**
   - Cleanup runs but `saved_by` not empty → Message persists ✅
   - **Saved messages never expire**

## 🎉 **Expected Behavior**

### Direct Messages (1-on-1):
- ✅ Send message → appears instantly
- ✅ Recipient opens chat → sees message
- ✅ Recipient stays in chat → message visible
- ✅ Recipient leaves chat → message disappears
- ✅ Sender doesn't need to "view" again

### Group Messages:
- ✅ Send to group → appears for all
- ✅ Recipients open chat one by one → message persists until last one
- ✅ Last recipient leaves → message disappears
- ✅ Any recipient can save → prevents expiration

### Save Feature:
- ✅ Long press to save → green border + 💾 icon
- ✅ Saved messages never expire
- ✅ Unsave → message will expire on next cleanup

## 🚀 **Test It Now!**

1. **Send a message from User A to User B**
2. **User B opens chat** → Should see message
3. **User B waits in chat** → Message should stay visible
4. **User B leaves chat** → Message should disappear
5. **No need for User A to open chat again!**

This is now the true Snapchat behavior! 🎯
