# Message Expiration Final Fix

## 🐛 Root Cause Identified

The issue was with the **auto-trigger** that marked senders as "viewed" when they sent messages:

### Problem Flow:
1. **User A sends message** → Auto-trigger marks User A as "viewed" 
2. **User B opens chat** → `markAllMessagesAsViewed()` marks User B as "viewed"
3. **Now `viewed_by = [User A, User B]`** → Equals participant count (2)
4. **User B leaves chat** → `cleanupExpiredMessages()` runs and deletes message
5. **Result**: Message disappears immediately, User B never gets to see it!

## ✅ Solution Implemented

**Removed the auto-trigger** that marks senders as "viewed":
```sql
-- Dropped these:
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS auto_mark_sender_viewed_trigger ON public.chat_messages;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS auto_mark_sender_viewed();
```

## 🎯 Correct Behavior Now

### Message Lifecycle:
1. **User A sends message** → `viewed_by = []` (empty)
2. **User B opens chat** → `viewed_by = [User B]` (only recipient)
3. **User B stays in chat** → Message remains visible
4. **User B leaves chat** → Message still exists (User A hasn't "viewed" it yet)
5. **User A opens chat** → `viewed_by = [User B, User A]` (both users)
6. **User A leaves chat** → NOW message expires (all participants have viewed)

### Key Points:
- ✅ **Senders are NOT automatically marked as "viewed"**
- ✅ **Messages only expire when ALL participants have opened the chat**
- ✅ **Messages stay visible while actively viewing**
- ✅ **Saved messages never expire**

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Message Flow
1. User A sends "Hello" to User B
2. User B opens chat → sees "Hello", message marked as viewed by User B
3. User B waits 10 seconds in chat → message still visible ✅
4. User B leaves chat → message still exists (User A hasn't viewed yet) ✅
5. User B reopens chat → message still there ✅
6. User A opens chat → message marked as viewed by User A
7. User A leaves chat → message expires (both viewed) ✅

### Test 2: Save Functionality
1. User A sends message to User B
2. User B opens chat and long-presses to save message
3. User A opens chat (both have now "viewed")
4. User A leaves chat → message stays (it's saved) ✅
5. User B can unsave → message will expire on next cleanup ✅

### Test 3: Group Chat
1. User A sends message to group (User B, User C)
2. User B opens chat → `viewed_by = [User B]`
3. User B leaves → message persists (User A and User C haven't viewed)
4. User A opens chat → `viewed_by = [User B, User A]`
5. User A leaves → message persists (User C hasn't viewed)
6. User C opens chat → `viewed_by = [User B, User A, User C]`
7. User C leaves → message expires (all 3 viewed) ✅

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Database Functions Modified:
1. **`mark_all_messages_as_viewed()`** - Only marks as viewed, no immediate expiration
2. **`cleanup_expired_messages()`** - Only runs when leaving chat
3. **Removed auto-trigger** - Senders not automatically marked as viewed

### Frontend Behavior:
- **On chat focus**: Mark messages as read + viewed
- **On chat blur**: Trigger cleanup
- **No more timers**: Removed 2-second and 1-second cleanup delays

## 🎉 Expected Results

Now the app should behave exactly like Snapchat:
- Messages appear when sent
- Recipients see messages when they open chat
- Messages stay visible while viewing
- Messages only disappear after everyone has opened the chat
- Save functionality prevents expiration
- Real-time updates work correctly

**Test it now!** Send a message and verify it doesn't disappear while viewing the chat. 🚀
