 Niche: Travel Enthusiasts Documenting Adventures and Recommendations

1. Niche Definition
Travel Enthusiasts want to capture and share their journeys—from hidden-gem food stalls in Bangkok to sunrise hikes in the Rockies—with friends and fellow explorers. SnapConnect will use RAG to surface ultra-relevant tips, craft vivid captions, and curate mini-guides that turn every snap into both a memory and a resource for other travelers.

2. Six RAG-Powered User Stories
Local Insight Injector
 “As a travel enthusiast, I want AI to suggest off-the-beaten-path spots near my current location (e.g., street markets, viewpoints) so my snaps can double as insider guides.”


RAG flow: Geolocation + user interests → query travel KB & user history → surface 3–5 bespoke recommendations.


Story Snippet Generator
 “As a travel enthusiast, I want AI to assemble a short narrative for my series of snaps (e.g., check-in, meal, activity) so I can post a cohesive mini-travelogue instantly.”


RAG flow: Ingest selected media + timestamps → retrieve relevant facts (opening hours, local lore) → generate a 4–6 snap storyboard text.


Caption Compass
 “As a travel enthusiast, I want AI to craft evocative, location-aware captions (e.g., ‘Chasing the sunset over Santorini’s caldera’) that match both the scene and my personal travel style.”


RAG flow: Image analysis + location metadata + profile style tags → generate 3 caption options.


Culture & Cuisine Coach
 “As a travel enthusiast, I want AI to recommend local dishes or cultural tips based on my snaps of restaurants or landmarks so I can share authentic foodie/culture snaps.”


RAG flow: Image/location → lookup regional cuisine & etiquette database → suggest 2–3 captions or sticker groups.


Flashback Explorer
 “As a travel enthusiast, I want AI to remind me of trips I took on this date last year (or earlier) and suggest a fresh angle or update, so I can create nostalgia-driven throws.”


RAG flow: Date-based retrieval from my travel logs → propose modernized caption or follow-up activity suggestion.


Itinerary Snapshot
 “As a travel enthusiast, I want AI to generate a concise visual itinerary snap (map snippet, bullet highlights) after I upload my travel plan, so I can quickly share what’s coming next.”


RAG flow: Parse my plain-text itinerary or calendar → query map & points-of-interest → produce a single-snap infographic with key stops.
